### Sourcehawk

Thank you for looking at the docs.  Getting started using the plugin locally and as a remote scan funciton are both pretty simple.

We will cover how to accomplish this in the [usage](usage/general) section.  We currently provide a [Maven plugin](usage/maven) as well as a downloadable [CLI](usage/cli) interface to use.  

There is a FaaS implementation behing the [Sourcehawk UI](usage/sourcehawk-ui) that we are working on integrating with CI systems.  This can be run manually for now.
