The way Sourcehawk is configured is through the usage of different types of Enforcers.  These enforcers are children of protocols and a protocol may have zero to many enforcers configured.  Enforcers are configurable rules that will run and produce [results](results).  You can find the available enforcers located here:

* [Common](../protocols/file/enforcers/common)
* [YAML](../protocols/file/enforcers/yaml)
* [XML](../protocols/file/enforcers/xml)
* [JSON](../protocols/file/enforcers/json)
* [Docker](../protocols/file/enforcers/docker)
* [Maven](../protocols/file/enforcers/maven)
